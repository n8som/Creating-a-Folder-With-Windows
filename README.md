# Creating-a-Folder-With-Windows

Creating a folder in Windows is super simple and if you're reading this you probably already know how, but here's how to do it anyways.

There are a few different ways you can create a folder, e.g. using the command line, using the GUI, and it is even possible to do it with just the keyboard. I will be showing you the simplest way. The first thing you need to do is to right-click anywhere on the desktop and a menu will appear:

Bring your mouse over "New" and another menu will appear:

Here you can see the first option "Folder". Select it and a new folder should appear on the desktop. It will be called "New Folder" by default, and the text should already be highlighted for you to edit the name of the folder.

If for some reason it isn't or you clicked somewhere before changing the name, you can just right-click the folder and select the "Rename" option to edit it.

Change it to whatever you'd like and your folder will have been created and named.

To verify, click on your folder to open it and a Windows Explorer window will pop up, showing the contents of your new empty folder.

And that's it! Thanks for reading!
